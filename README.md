##Project Description 

Calling APIs is the most common thing to do in any modern web application. When it comes to talking with an API then most of the time we need to do a lot of repetitive things like getting data from an API call, handling the success or error case, and so on.

The problem comes when we start adding new features on top of the existing features without handling the API calls in an efficient and reusable manner. 

We can avoid this problem by creating resuseable hook and use that hook to make mutiple api calls

You can start by looking at hooks/useAPpi.js -- the resueable hook we have created to make api calls 

We are using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ JASON PLACEHOLDER for making fake api calls 

##Styling
